Tools to continue being a coder when typing causes hand pain (and RSI survival tips)

## My History
In December 2014, after 23 years of heavy computer use as a software engineer, I started having severe pain in my finger joints. Since then, I cannot type for an extended period of time without causing pain for days later. Medical procedures have been unfruitful and it is supposed to be arthritis caused by repetitive stress. 

Therefore, my last 4 years have been spent looking for alternatives so I can continue my career writing code. I have tried countless hardware and software solutions including keyboards, pens, speech, and touch.

**I have discovered the optimum combination of tools that have allowed me to continue to code efficiently without stressing my fingers. I am making this public so that others in a similar situation may use it and have hope and success.**

## The Solution

1. Wacom pen tablet with customized buttons
1. Windows 10 Touch Keyboard in Mobile configuration
1. AutoHotKey script

## Requirements

1. Windows 10 (Home or Professional)
1. Wacom tablet (Intuos or Intuos Pro)
1. AutoHotKey (version 1.1 or later, free download)

## Software Suggestions
1. Microsoft Edge is the only browser to support swiping and word suggestions on the touch keyboard (as of April 2019). Use Edge for any website that involves typing words.
1. Use an advanced IDE such as Jetbrains. This will provide great auto-completion of variable and function names.

## Other Suggestions

1. Consult medical professionals. Each situation is different.
1. If typing is causing you pain, stop typing as soon as possible. Do not cause further damage.
1. Hide your physical keyboard: unplug in or throw a towel over it. Otherwise you will be tempted temptation to use it is
